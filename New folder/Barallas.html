<h4> My Bio: </h4> 
<p> I am Gabriel Angelo Barallas and I am a BSIT student major in Mobile and Internet Technologies. I am humorous person, family-oriented guy. I love to explore and create innovative ideas
and I also play music and guitar. In my senior highschool days I play basketball and chess as my sports and I am involved in speech choir club which
 involves acting and singing. My parents and my auncle pushed me into this course since I know logic and some arithmetic. It was hard but it was fun. 
I already got into group projects like bus scheduling system using java. I already developed some systems in python like the grade calculator with an interface and mobile chatting app in our mobile programming
subject using java.</p>
